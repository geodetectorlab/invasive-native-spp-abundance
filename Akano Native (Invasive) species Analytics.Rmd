This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

#The data was upload using the R script and then it was filtered the select some necessary parameters/columns from the original data and now named invasive. The columns selected are species, plot_id, family, and the frequency.

# And here is R script has well to run the above step


invasive_1 = select(data, species, plot_id, family, Occurrence, )

# frequency = (No of quadrates of occurrence of species/ Total no of studied plot) * 100 according to literature in which they use the frequency as the number of occurrence.
# Density = Total no of individuals of a species in all quadrates / Total no of quadrates studies
# Abundance = Total no of individuals of a species in all quadrates / Total of quadrates in which species occured
# Relative Frequency = Frequency of the species / Frequency of all species
# Relative Density = Density of species / Density of all species
# All these formula above are extracted from the previous literature on assessment of invasive species "Sheneto 2016"

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
